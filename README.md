# Poke-crush ðŸŽ®

An addictive Match-3 game inspired by Candy Crush Saga, but set in the vibrant world of PokÃ©mon! Swap adjacent PokÃ©mon to form rows or columns of 3 or more identical creatures and aim for the high score.

This project was built purely with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or external libraries) as a learning exercise and for fun.
